					Hi, my name is Brooke!</p>
					<p>I am from the beautiful state of Colorado. I have lived there most of my life and love it. Every day growing up I had the opportunity to have the beautiful view of the rocky mountains. I find great peace and joy in being outside and exploring the amazing creations that this world has to offer. My favorite outdoor activity has to be trail runninng. It's my way of meditating.</p>
					<p>When I am not outside or on a nice run, you can usually find me listening to music, spending time with family, eating food, or doing all three at once. Music helps me feel calm and stress free. I am always looking to discover new artists to listen to. My family are my best friends. We love to do everything together. We especially love to eat. Most of what we do is centered around food. Mexican food is one of our favorites. There is nothing better than one of my grandpas homemade tacos!</p>
					<p>Right now I am studying Web Design and Development. Trying to figure out what I wanted to study was difficult.But now that I am here I am LOVING it! I constantly have a thirst to learn more and to improve my skills. I look forward to learning more this semester!</p>
